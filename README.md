Hash Server
-----------

**_A simple hashing microservice_**

Hashes (and optionally salts) passwords using one or more rounds of
SHA512. Inserts an arbitrary 5-second delay into the hashing path to
ease concurrency analysis.

### Caveats ###

This server accepts unencrypted and unauthenticated `http` requests by
default, which is wholly inappropriate for a system receiving
plaintext password requests. This should be updated to run over TLS
(i.e. `https`) prior to passing any real password data through the
system. At the very least, it should be proxied via an `https` server
prior to exposing to a public network.

Furthermore, sha512 isn't a great choice for a password hash due to
how quickly the algorithm is designed to run. This issue can be
mitigated by using multiple rounds of SHA512, but a better solution
would be to use a hashing algorithm with a variable work load such as
[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt).

This system also currently leaks the length, first, and last letter of
each password to the log in the form of `a****z` for each password it
hashes. It's up to the user whether or not the debugging benefit this
leakage provides outweighs the security risk of logging such data.

Finally, although the system makes salting optional, in a real
deployment, salting should be mandatory to subvert rainbow-table
attacks on the resulting password hashes.

### Dependencies ###

+ https://github.com/braintree/manners

### Setup ###

```
$ git clone https://github.com/asayler/hash-server.git
$ go get https://github.com/braintree/manners
```

### Run ###

_By default, the server runs on port 8080_

```
$ go run serv.go [port]
```

### Client Request Examples ###

_Data is returned base64 encoded. When salts are used, salt is
returned first and separated from hash output via `|`._

**Hash password using SHA512**

**Stop accepting requests and shutdown server once in-flight requests complete**
```
$ curl -X POST --data "shutdown=" http://[host]:[port]
